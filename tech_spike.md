# Tech spike

In this tech spike we compared GitLab Pages and DigitalOcean 
to decide which one to use to host our website.

## GitLab Pages 

### Pros
+ Very easy to setup and integrate with your GitLab project. 
+ Changes to the website are automatically deployed when you push your changes. 
+ It is free to use. 

### Cons
+ Does not support dynamic server-side processing.


## DigitalOcean

### Pros
+ Supports dynamic server-side processing. 
+ Would allow our tests to be faster and not limited. 
+ Would serve as a learning oppurtunity, for example webservers, CD, and Linux. 

### Cons
+ Is not free to use. (Note: With GitHub Student Pack you have access to a $50 voucher.)



## Verdict
We went with GitLab Pages because it's easy-to-use nature was a perfect fit 
for the current stage in our project.
